## General Information
- To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution which can evaluate images and alert the dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.
- To create a multiclass classification model using a custom convolutional neural network in tensorflow

## Conclusions
- Without data augmentation and dropouts we saw overfitted model clearly.
- With data augmentation and dropouts overfitting was completely completely.
- With Batch Normalization and Augumentation overfitting was handled, accuracy was improved by more   than 93 %  and validation accuracy upto 77 %
